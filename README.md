# Udacity - Data Model Project

ETL for Song Data

<hr/>

## How to install and get it up and running

Requirements:  Python (os, pandas, sql_queries, psycopg2, glob), Jupyter notebook

1)  Set up Data folder in root directory.
2)  Execute create_tables.py
3)  Execute etl.py
4)  Test queries with test.ipynb

## Introduction
Taking two sets of JSON data (song and log), the scripts insert the data into five tables in PostGres.  The tables are logically set up as:  users, songs, artists, songplay, and time.  

## Architecture
The project workspace includes six files:
1) test.ipynb displays the first few rows of each table to check the database.
2) create_tables.py drops and creates tables. You run this file to reset tables before each time ETL scripts are ran.
3) etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
4) etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into tables. 
5) sql_queries.py contains all sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
6) README.md provides discussion on project.

## Dataset
CSong Dataset:
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 

Log Dataset:
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

## Tables
Fact Table:
songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

Dimension Tables:
users - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

songs - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

artists - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
